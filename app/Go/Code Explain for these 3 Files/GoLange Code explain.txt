Explanation of the Blockchain code
TL;DR
The code implements a simple blockchain in Go. It defines a Transaction struct, a Block struct, and a Blockchain 
struct. It also defines several functions to handle HTTP requests, including handleGet, handleSubmit, 
handleChain, handleNewTransaction, handleMine, and handlePendingTransactions. The code uses the Gorilla Mux 
library to handle HTTP routing and the encoding/json package to encode and decode JSON data.
Explanation
The code implements a simple blockchain in Go. It defines a Transaction struct, which represents a transaction in 
the blockchain. The Transaction struct has four fields: Author, which represents the author of the transaction, 
Content, which represents the content of the transaction, Index, which represents the index of the transaction in 
the blockchain, and Time, which represents the timestamp of the transaction.
The code also defines a Block struct, which represents a block in the blockchain. The Block struct has five fields: 
Index, which represents the index of the block in the blockchain, Timestamp, which represents the timestamp of the 
block, Transactions, which is an array of Transaction structs representing the transactions in the block, Hash, 
which represents the hash of the block, and PrevHash, which represents the hash of the previous block in the 
blockchain.
The code also defines a Blockchain struct, which represents the blockchain. The Blockchain struct has two fields: 
Chain, which is an array of Block structs representing the blocks in the blockchain, and PendingTransactions, 
which is an array of Transaction structs representing the transactions that have not yet been added to a block.
The code defines several functions to handle HTTP requests. The handleGet function handles GET requests to the root 
URL. It fetches the blockchain from a connected node, renders a template with the blockchain data, and returns the 
template as a response.
The handleSubmit function handles POST requests to the /submit URL. It parses the form data, creates a new 
Transaction struct, and adds it to the PendingTransactions array in the Blockchain struct.
The handleChain function handles GET requests to the /chain URL. It encodes the Blockchain struct as JSON and 
returns it as a response.
The handleNewTransaction function handles POST requests to the /new_transaction URL. It decodes the JSON data in 
the request body, creates a new Transaction struct, and adds it to the PendingTransactions array in the 
Blockchain struct.
The handleMine function handles GET requests to the /mine URL. It creates a new block by adding the pending 
transactions to the blockchain, calculating the hash of the new block, and adding the new block to the blockchain. It 
then encodes the new block as JSON and returns it as a response.
The handlePendingTransactions function handles GET requests to the /pending_transactions URL. It encodes the 
PendingTransactions array in the Blockchain struct as JSON and returns it as a response.
The code uses the Gorilla Mux library to handle HTTP routing and the encoding/json package to encode and decode JSON 
data.
Possible bugs

The code does not handle errors that may occur during HTTP requests or JSON encoding/decoding.
The code does not handle conflicts that may occur when multiple nodes try to add blocks to the blockchain at the same 
time.
The code does not implement a consensus algorithm to ensure that all nodes have the same copy of the blockchain.

Possible improvements

Add error handling to the HTTP request and JSON encoding/decoding functions.
Implement a consensus algorithm to ensure that all nodes have the same copy of the blockchain.
Add support for multiple cryptocurrencies or tokens.
Add support for smart contracts or other advanced blockchain features.
